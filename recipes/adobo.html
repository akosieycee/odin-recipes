        <!-- Chicken Adobo Cooking Instructions -->

        <h3>Steps:</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Heat the vegetable/canola oil in a large pan over medium-high heat. Cook the chicken pieces until golden brown, probably around 4 minutes on each side. Transfer the chicken pieces onto a plate and set them aside.</li>
            <li>Saute the garlic and onions on the same pan, and cook them until softened and brown. Put the chicken pieces back onto the pan, then pour in the soy sauce and vinegar, and season with it sugar, black pepper. Also, add the bay leaves.</li>
            <li>Increase the heat to high, and bring it to a boil. Reduce heat to medium-low when it boils, then cover it and simmer until the chicken pieces are tender and cooked through, approximately 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>Transfer it to a serving bowl, and it's best paired with cooked white rice.</li>
        </ol>
